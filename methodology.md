# Categorising write in labels

## Why am I bothering with this

This survey focuses on *what* language people use, but not the categories implied by that language (as different people will describe the same experience differently, and notably write-ins are prone to painting a picture more so than practical categorisation (ie "like if la croix was boy flavoured" <- nonsense that implies a vague male-alignment but invokes Other Stuff to explain it in a personalised way))

I am trying to extract useable data from write ins to complement the limited tick box labels and be able to make more nuanced analytical statements about the patterns represented in this data set. 

- collecting useable word categories 

    - ex. common labels, including ones that were provided and written in anyway (smh), intersections (ie relation to neurodivergence/autism; queer (sexuality-related) labels; etc), alignment with or opposed to binary gender roles, etc

- grouping them according to same labels & meanings to count them as more than just their individual spellings 

    - ex. "gender-flux" and "genderflux" would be counted as two different items due to different spelling if counting automatically, but they mean the same thing -> should be counted together

    - ex. looking for the word "girl" will yield both things like "gay girl" and "definitely not a girl" -> opposite meanings (female-aligned vs explicitly non-female), need to be separated accordingly

- creating new categories that hold relevant info 

    - ex. survey doesn't collect info about birth assignments (* shakes fist at op *), but there is info implying or explicitly stating birthsex in the write ins (ie "afab", "male to female", "transmasc", "cis woman", "pussyboy", etc) or info that can be combined with tick box labels to conclude on birthsex (ie someone who ticked "trans" and wrote in "boy" -> presumably transmasc -> afab) -> this info, while limited can give us insight into what birthsex distribution may be/if certain groups are more likely to write in info on birthsex than others


## Who made me the label police / how am I categorising these things

Our People (the gender questionable and -queer community at large) are too dang particular about language. Mogai was a mistake. You need to go outside and touch grass, everyone. (And most of you need to learn a language other than english before @ ing me.)

In my continued quest to help my community and our theory to reconnect with the realities of living as gender queer/trans/etc people and restore at least some of our collective sanity:

- I am ignoring some of the "nuance" (past what I decide is reasonable) contained in the write in answers

    - ex. Stuff like "I'm a boy but not a man" is a silly distinction. It implies male alignment (boy) but is specific about not wanting another male aligned word (man) to be used -> distinction is not about gender alignment but about language specifics to an extent that cannot reasonably be enforced irl 

        - "I want to be gendered as male" = reasonable, doable ask of the cis ppl in your life, will be as effective as possible to prevent misgendering as female (which is generally implied by explicitly calling oneself a word firmly aligned with the male gender role and no mention of a similar word from the female one (as opposed to stuff like "half-boy, half-girl"))

        - "I want to be gendered as male but ONLY IN *THIS* WAY, not *this other way* that is synonymous to the majority of the population but has implications *I* personally don't like well enough" = unreasonably specific, will not be executed correctly by the average cis person, implies dislike of male gender that will enable misgendering as female rather than prevent it

    - ex. Stuff like "just a lil guy (gender neutral)" is a reasonable distinction. Guy is used gender neutrally enough in english that it is not as gender explicit as words like "boy" or "man" (ie I've heard cis women use this phrase on themselves, the plural "guys" is used gender neutrally, and meme phrases like "women are my favourite guy" exist).

- As such I am not making distinctions between different ways to phrase a thing (ie girl, woman, female, etc are synonymous, as are boy, man, male, etc) unless I can tell that there is a reasonable distinction being made

    - ex. "trans female" implies trans woman -> making it female aligned

    - ex. "female passing" implies a state of *looking* like but not necessarily identifying as female -> is not counted as female aligned

- I also want to extract as much tangibly useful info as possible (ie what this person's gender may look like irl like birthsex, expression, trans status, etc; what kind of challenges they face and experiences they have based on it/who they share those with; etc) and find any conflicting statements (ie something that cannot reasonably be true at the same time/does not work like that irl)

    - ex. "100% Woman 100% Man" is a conflicting statement because that's not how percentages work, dear. It is also not how our species' sex (even among intersex folks, and their variety of specific intersex conditions, there are no ""true hermaphrodites"" with both sexes fully realised, to my understanding) or society's gender roles (which are mutually exclusive as a binary system) work for what it's worth. It is a state one cannot actually achieve, physically or socially.

    - ex. Malewife is not a conflicting statement, because I have never heard it being used in a way that wasn't explicitly about a male(-aligned) character or person. It, as a word, is used in an explicitly male way, so it implies an explicit male-alignment. -> This is an assessment I can make based on my common knowledge of english slang.
    
    - ex. Dykefag is a conflicting statement, because it does not provide much useful information other than that this person really likes slurs and identifies as part of the wider queer community in some fashion. It provides neither info on their gender alignment, expression, or even sexual orientation (as dyke and fag would on their own), rendering it largely useless for gathering additional tangibly useful info. 

- For the sake of this project I am using my usual definition of transmasc and transfemme: They are categories to connote direction, not leaning within that direction (ex they include unaligned nonbinaries of the relevant direction even if they do not identify as trans or the label in question)

    - as such I am also not categorising responses that only mention transmasc/transfemme but do not specify further gender alignment as aligned, merely grouping them with their direction. (ie "transfem" will be grouped under transfemme but not woman-aligned)

    - ex. "I am a trans woman (but not transfem)" indicates a misunderstanding of what transfemme refers to (I think they thought it meant trans and feminine (-> they do not identify as feminine I guess??), which it does not) and will still be counted as transfemme, due to stating trans womanhood (which is under the transfemme umbrella)

- Certain terms that in reasonable application or under the used definition are mutually exclusive opposites will be treated as such (ie cis/trans, transmasc/transfemme, etc)

    - ex. "I am both a cis woman and a trans man" is a conflicting statement, you cannot be both of those things at once, they are mutually exclusive. This statement does however provide the info that this person is afab either way.

    - ex. "a transfemme transmasc" is a conflicting statement, you cannot be both of those things at once, they are mutually exclusive. This is once again a highly useless statement as it does not hint at which word is the tangible real life category that applies. (ie is this a transmasc who identifies with certain transfemme aesthetics? is this a transfemme who would have preferred to be born afab & then be transmasc about it? is it a detransitioner??? WE HAVE NO MEANS OF KNOWING)

I am taking the liberty to disregard replies that cannot provide useful info, are actively conflicting, and/or are obvious joke answers (which there are a lot of -.- why are you people like this).


# No but for real why are you doing this

I believe that there are major oversights and biases in any statistical data we have on the nonbinary/genderqueer community, including in this survey. 

- In [the USTS](https://ustranssurvey.org/) we have seen that the horrendous 80% afab / 20% amab ratio has barely budged in 7 years of awareness raising and in spite of seeing a much higher participation number overall.

- Even in the gender census, despite OP's continued refusal to collect birthsex, we have seen that transmasculine made it to the top 10 labels for years while transfemme has not made the cut.


I believe them to be caused by our existing theory as largely developed and popularised by the afab part of the community in favour of amab-originated ideas and practices, not by any inherent difference in the distribution of genderqueerness among birthsexes.

- OP largely operates from tumblr, which we know to be highly afab dominated, and from what I can already see in the "how did you find this survey" unique responses, did not bother reposting on known amab dominated sites with a huge transfemme et al population like reddit, where the survey seems to only have made an appearance via a screenshot on r/tumblr, with no other subreddits mentionned, including NONE of the known and popular genderqueer ones like various trans and nonbinary subreddits and crossdressing communities like r/femboys.
    
    I plan on reposting it there next time (and invite anyone else reading this to join me in cross promoting it), just to see how much it'll screw with the numbers to balance those ratios a little more for once.

- I believe it is not only a promotional issue (ie basic outreach work to make sure the amabs know about it), but also a cultural one, in that a lot of amab genderqueer culture revolves around crossdressing practice (drag, femboys, crossplaying as cute anime girls on vrchat, private sexual crossdressing, etc) until a label change is inevitable (ex. once they start medical transition), while afab genderqueer culture relies more on various labels like nonbinary even while/if they do not pursue medical transition.


I am complicit in this state of things, as one of the afab people who has spent a significant number of years educating on the existing system and not doing outreach work as someone who largely worked out of tumblr and has yet to make a reddit account as I am typing this.

I care more about gender liberation than about upholding whatever shitty status quo we've created to please mother (= the female gender role we as genderqueer afab people have not appropriately liberated ourselves from the clutches of), and as a gender non-conforming man and friend of many transfemmes, and, most notably, as a data person who cares about achieving the highest possible accuracy even in my social science data sets, I cannot stand by this insane bias when it could be resolved with a bare minimum of 

1) realising there is an issue (amabs are still not represented appropriately, gender roles are still not significantly more liberated than they were 10 years ago)

2) that we were wrong about what we thought caused it (amab ignorance about our fun new nb labels) and our approach to "solving" it (awareness raising for said nb labels) didn't work ((this point is hard bc fragile femininity says we are not allowed to be wrong ever -> we need to question and overcome that to be and do better for our siblings!))

3) do literally any amount of outreach work and do not constrain ourselves to certain labels/language usage, notably when we have a project we want the whole community to be involved in (ex. include and encourage language other than just "nonbinary" as a default, ex. crosspost our survey on relevant subreddits)
